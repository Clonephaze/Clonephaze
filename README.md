## Hey there ðŸ‘‹, thanks for checking out my page!

True to my name, I like being a jack-of-all-trades and as such I like to dable and really get to understand a lot of different fields. I am a web developer mostly for fun though I've made a few projects now that I'm proud of and are actively in use. I can work in jQuery and vanilla JavaScript, HTML and Css, Python, and batch scripting.

### Projects

[ðŸ–¥ Dangerous to go Alone Wiki!](https://github.com/Clonephaze/DtgA) A website I designed and coded for the awesome mod "Dangerous to go Alone" for Breath of the Wild!

[ðŸ¤– Clone's test bot](https://github.com/Clonephaze/Clones-Test-Bot) My own Discord bot, always being updated and improved. Mostly a project for me to practice my JavaScript, Python, and batch skills.

[ðŸŽ² Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock!](https://clonephaze.github.io/RockPaperScissors/) This one is a bit more of a fun project, a game of rock paper scissors lizard spock like from BBT. It was a challenge given to me that I had a lot of fun figuring out how to work.
