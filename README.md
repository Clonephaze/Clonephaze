## Hey there 👋, thanks for chekcing out my page!

My name is Jack, and I'm a software developer. I am able to work fairly efficiently with JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. I am also working on learning C. I have a couple projects I've made here but hopefully there will many more to come.

### Projects

[🤖 Clone's test bot](https://github.com/Clonephaze/Clones-Test-Bot) My own Discord bot, always being updated and improved. Mostly a project for me to practice my JavaScript, Python, and batch skills.

[👨‍💻 Base DiscordSJ Bot](https://github.com/Clonephaze/Base-DiscordJS-Bot) My own take on a template bot for DiscordJS V14. My take on this includes a completely custom set of install scripts that installs absolutely everything including dependancies for you.
