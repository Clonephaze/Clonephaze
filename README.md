### Projects

[🖥 Dangerous to go Alone Wiki!](https://github.com/Clonephaze/DtgA) A wiki designed soley by me for the mod "Dangerous to go Alone" for breath of the wild!

[🤖 Clone's test bot](https://github.com/Clonephaze/Clones-Test-Bot) My own Discord bot, always being updated and improved. Mostly a project for me to practice my JavaScript, Python, and batch skills.

[👨‍💻 Base DiscordSJ Bot](https://github.com/Clonephaze/Base-DiscordJS-Bot) My own take on a template bot for DiscordJS V14. My take on this includes a completely custom set of install scripts that installs absolutely everything including dependancies for you.
