## Hey there üëã, thanks for checking out my page!

True to my name, I like being a jack-of-all-trades and as such I like to dable and really get to understand a lot of different fields. I am a web developer mostly for fun though I've made a few projects now that I'm proud of and are actively in use. I can work in jQuery and vanilla JavaScript, HTML and Css, Python, and batch scripting.
